## Code Obfuscation

The JavaScript code in this repository is obfuscated to protect intellectual property and enhance security. Code obfuscation is a security technique used to make the code more difficult to understand or reverse-engineer. While it provides an additional layer of security, it is not a substitute for best practices in secure coding.

## Security Best Practices

We encourage all contributors and users to follow these security best practices:

- Regularly update dependencies to ensure you are using the latest, most secure versions.
- Use strong and unique passwords for your accounts.
- Be cautious when sharing sensitive information, and avoid sharing credentials or API keys in public forums.
- Implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms when deploying any software from this repository in a production environment.

By following these best practices and responsibly disclosing any security issues, we can work together to maintain a secure environment for everyone using Keerthana-Bot.

Thank you for your contribution to the security of our project.
